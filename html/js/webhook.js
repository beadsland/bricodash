incoming-webhooks App API was made by a member of the Slack team to help
connect Slack with a third-party service; these apps may not be tested,
documented, or supported by Slack in the way we support our core offerings,
like Slack Enterprise Grid and Slack for Teams. You may provide feedback
about these apps at <mailto:feedback@slack.com>.

It only uses data Slack already has access to (view our Privacy Policy to
learn more). By enabling and/or using this app, you may be connecting with
a service that is not part of Slack.

Getting started: https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks
