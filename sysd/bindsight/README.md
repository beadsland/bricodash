# BindSight

Concurrent frame-scrubbing webcam broadcast gateway daemon.

Devoted service to stream doorcam and spacecam to Bricodash and public
gateway, respectively, while tracking activity and performance of these
and other webcams at the space. Will be more efficient and reliable than
spawning PHP and Python processes on an as-they-come basis.
